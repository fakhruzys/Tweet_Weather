# Tweet_Weather

A simple project that simply tweets a weather report of that day from Python. The weather report is to be scrapped from another website. So this project is just a combination of the Twitter API and web scrapping concept. This project is purely for self-interest and for me to learn how to do web scrapping

Will update as the project develops
